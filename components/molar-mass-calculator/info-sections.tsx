            What is Molar Mass
          </h2>

          <div className="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 max-w-none space-y-4">
            <p>
              The molar mass is the total mass of all the elements present in a
              molecule or compound, measured in grams per mole (g/mol). It is
              calculated by taking the atomic mass of each element, as listed in
              the periodic table, multiplying it by the number of atoms of that
              element in the formula, and then adding these values together.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, to calculate the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2):
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Atomic mass of Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol</li>
              <li>Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol</li>
              <li>Molar mass of CO2 = (1 × 12.01) + (2 × 16.00)</li>
              <li>Molar mass of CO2 = 12.01 + 32.00 = 44.01 g/mol</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In chemistry, during various calculations, you often need to add
              molar mass values. For example, in a molarity calculation using a
              molarity calculator, along with mass and volume, knowing the molar
              mass is very important.
            </p>

            <p>
              Calculating the molar mass of simple molecules is not difficult,
              but when it comes to complex molecules, manual calculations can
              become a bit lengthy—especially when you need results instantly.
              In such cases, our molar mass calculator quickly provides you with
              the accurate molar mass without any delay.
